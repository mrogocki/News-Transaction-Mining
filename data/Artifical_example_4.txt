German Railway Announces New Pricing Scheme

The German railway has announced a new pricing scheme that will take effect from January 1st, 2023. According to the new scheme, passengers will be charged based on the distance they travel and the time of day they travel.

The new pricing scheme is aimed at making the railway more affordable for passengers and reducing congestion during peak hours. The railway has been facing criticism for its high ticket prices, especially during peak hours, and this new scheme is seen as a way to address these concerns.

Under the new scheme, passengers will be charged a base fare of €2.10 for journeys up to 100 kilometers, and then an additional €0.20 for every kilometer traveled thereafter. Journeys made between 6am and 9am and between 4pm and 7pm will be subject to a surcharge of €0.50 per journey.

The railway has also introduced a new ticket called the "Flexpreis", which allows passengers to travel on any train within a specific region for a fixed price. The Flexpreis is available for journeys up to 500 kilometers and costs €44.90 for one day
